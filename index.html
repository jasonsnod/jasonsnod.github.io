                <h2>About Jason</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing his Bachelor's and Master's in music, Jason both taught and performed on a freelance basis.
                    He taught at a nonprofit for a year before switching to one-on-one lessons and holding a studio of nearly 50 students.
                    Along with that he performed with multiple groups of varying styles and most recently did an extended stint of performing on cruise ships.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He always has had a strong interest in technology, even building his own computer while in high school, so he finally decided to make it a core part of his career aspirations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Jason is excited to start creating new projects and working on solutions that can solve your company's technological needs. He is most interested in the background logistics of a companies online presence.
